# IISLogFileTrafficGenerator

Generates web traffic by reading the IIS http log files and replaying each request. With it you can replay web traffic coming into a server by using a IIS log file as a source for creating web requests and allowing you to generate real world traffic in a testing scenario instead of relying on static tests of a few pages.
